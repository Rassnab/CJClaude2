  title: "Scandic Hotels — Strategic Customer Journey Framework"
  subtitle: "Workshop Draft | Synthesised from source materials | February 2026"
  where_to_win_theme: >
    Consistent, recognised, personal service — guests who feel seen and valued at every
    transition point (booking, check-in, in-stay, loyalty) are measurably more satisfied,
    more loyal, and more likely to return. Scandic's differentiation opportunity lies in
    making human warmth as reliable as its brand promise across all hotels, not as a happy accident.

# ─── 7 JOURNEY STAGES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
stages:
  - id: 1
    short_label: "Dream & Discover"
    customer_language: "I want to go somewhere"
    complete_when: "…the guest has identified a destination or occasion and is actively considering hotel options."
    success_statement: "The guest feels excited and is already picturing their stay — Scandic is on their consideration list."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Feels inspired by a Scandic property because content feels personally relevant."
      - "Can find Scandic surfaced in the channels they naturally use (social, meta-search, OTA)."
      - "Understands what makes Scandic different — brand communicates personality, not just room specs."
      - "Destination and hotel presented as a complete experience, not separate decisions."
    evidence: "Leisure guests think destination-first, hotel-second. Pain A1 ('few discover Scandic via social media and metasearch') appears across both business and leisure CJMs."

  - id: 2
    short_label: "Select & Book"
    customer_language: "I'm choosing and booking"
    complete_when: "…the guest has confirmed a reservation and received a booking confirmation from Scandic (direct or via OTA)."
    success_statement: "The guest feels confident they made the right choice and knows exactly what they've booked — no surprises expected."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Can compare room types, prices, and hotels quickly without losing their place."
      - "Feels certain about what they are paying for — no hidden costs or surprises."
      - "Can customise booking with basic preferences (room attributes, add-ons) in a single flow."
      - "Knows how to use membership number, loyalty points, or corporate discount without calling."
      - "Booking confirmation clearly states what was booked and what happens next."
      - "Guests who book via OTA understand the limitations and how to connect loyalty benefits."
    evidence: "Booking has the highest correlation (0.6) to overall experience score. Pain points B1–B6, A3, A5–A8 all cluster here. WOW initiative #5 targets customisable ancillary booking."

  - id: 3
    short_label: "Prepare"
    customer_language: "I'm getting ready"
    complete_when: "…the guest has the practical information they need and any pre-stay communication has been received."
    success_statement: "The guest feels prepared and looked-after — they can anticipate a smooth arrival without unanswered questions."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Scandic anticipates pre-arrival needs (parking, late arrival, directions) without the guest having to search."
      - "Can easily view, change, or add to their booking online without calling the hotel."
      - "Knows how to contact the hotel and gets a timely response."
      - "Members can see what benefits apply to their upcoming stay."
    evidence: "Pre-stay comms rated 4.0–4.1. Pain C1 (can't adjust booking online) is a top call-centre driver. Pain C3/C4 (slow response, hard to reach hotel) scores high in qualitative sentiment."

  - id: 4
    short_label: "Arrive & Check In"
    customer_language: "I'm arriving and settling in"
    complete_when: "…the guest has completed check-in, received their key, and is in their room or on their way to it."
    success_statement: "The guest feels welcomed as an individual — not a queue number — and their first impression is positive."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Welcomed as an individual from the first interaction — not like they are in a queue."
      - "Can check in without waiting more than a few minutes, through a channel of their choice."
      - "Loyal members feel visibly recognised and receive a small, meaningful acknowledgement."
      - "Room matches what they booked — no unpleasant first impression."
      - "Knows key stay facts (breakfast time, WiFi, room location) without having to ask."
      - "Guests who arrive early or late feel the hotel has a solution, not a policy statement."
    evidence: "Arrival/check-in scored 4.4 overall, yet slow check-in (pain D1) ranks 3rd in leisure pain severity. Gain points G1–G4 (welcome note, gift, info-kit, upgrade) all activate at arrival. 'Marketplace Lobby' WOW initiative targets this moment."

  - id: 5
    short_label: "In-Stay"
    customer_language: "I'm living the stay"
    complete_when: "…the guest has slept at the hotel at least one night, experienced breakfast, and had some interaction with staff or facilities."
    success_statement: "The guest feels comfortable, taken care of, and getting personal value — room, food, and service meet or exceed expectations."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Room is clean, quiet, and matches the standard described at booking."
      - "Genuinely good breakfast without excessive queuing or running out of items — at least one above-average element."
      - "Staff are visibly present, approachable, and genuinely warm — not just transactionally polite."
      - "Can get a personalised local recommendation from staff, not a generic brochure."
      - "Members and repeat guests feel Scandic uses what it knows about them."
      - "Guests with specific needs (families, international guests, accessibility) feel the hotel considered them."
    evidence: "Restaurant/food rated 3.7 (leisure) — lowest in-stay score. Gain G9 ('Surprisingly good breakfast') and G5 ('Make the customer feel seen') are highest-potential gains. WOW initiative #4 (personalised guest experience) directly targets in-stay recognition."

  - id: 6
    short_label: "Departure"
    customer_language: "I'm leaving"
    complete_when: "…the guest has returned their key, settled their bill, and departed the hotel."
    success_statement: "The guest leaves with a positive final impression — the end of the stay feels as considered as the beginning."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Can check out quickly through a channel of their choice without queuing at reception."
      - "Understands their bill and knows loyalty points earned are registered."
      - "Late check-out or luggage storage is available without negotiating."
      - "Leaves with a clear and warm final interaction that provides a natural close to the stay."
    evidence: "Majority prefer to check out at reception despite digital options. Late check-out inflexibility is a pain across segments. Check-out scored 4.4 in leisure — highest in-stay touchpoint — suggesting a good foundation."

  - id: 7
    short_label: "Re-live & Loyalty"
    customer_language: "I'm looking back and deciding whether to return"
    complete_when: "…the guest has processed their stay, responded to (or ignored) post-stay communication, and formed a view on whether to recommend or return."
    success_statement: "The guest feels the stay was worth it, remembers it positively, and — if a member — feels the loyalty programme adds real value."
    key_outcomes:
      - "Post-stay communication is relevant to their actual stay and worth reading — not generic spam."
      - "Guests who had a problem feel it has been heard and followed up."
      - "Scandic Friends members understand how to use their points and find the benefits genuinely compelling."
      - "Guests who had a good stay can easily share their experience and leave a review."
      - "Feels a natural reason to return — a relevant offer or a positive memory."
    evidence: "Post-stay comms rated 3.7 (business) — the single lowest touchpoint score. Member benefits rated 3.3 for Habituals — the single lowest score in the entire journey. Pain F1: 'too much irrelevant post-stay communication'. Scandic Friends pains F3/F4 are significant churn risks."

# ─── 5 HERO MOMENTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
hero_moments:
  - id: 1
    title: "The Booking That Earns Trust"
    icon: "🔐"
    primary_stage: 2
    adjacent_stages: [1, 3]
    criteria_score: "5/5"
    feasibility_note: "incremental"
    customer_promise: >
      The customer will complete their booking feeling confident, unstressed, and certain
      about what they've paid for — with no need to call, verify, or second-guess.
    customer_value:
      - "Booking is the highest-anxiety digital touchpoint; complexity here creates a negative halo that colours the entire stay."
      - "Ability to customise in the booking flow directly addresses the top customer demand: 'I want to feel like my stay is tailored to me.'"
    business_value:
      - "Booking has the highest correlation (0.6) to overall experience score; improvements here have outsized downstream effect."
      - "Conversion rate improvement is directly measurable; significant drop-off shown especially at payment."
    what_great_looks_like:
      - "A guest completes a booking in under 5 minutes on mobile, selects a preference (high floor, breakfast), and receives a confirmation that clearly restates what was booked and what to expect next."
      - "A Scandic Friends member's loyalty number, points balance, and applicable benefits are pre-filled and visible throughout the booking flow without a separate login step."
    failure_modes:
      - "Guests who book via OTAs (50% of international leisure guests) never experience this moment on Scandic's platform, eroding personalisation and loyalty."
      - "Opera Cloud and IT dependencies mean customisable booking may take longer to implement than customer patience allows."
    key_evidence:
      - "Pain B1 (cumbersome personal detail entry) and B2 (payment drop-out) are high-frequency."
      - "'Booking is one of the touchpoints with the greatest impact on overall experience' [Business CJM 2017 – p.22]"
      - "WOW Initiative #5 proposes customisable ancillaries in the booking flow."
      - "Leisure pain A3 (hard to compare/filter hotels) scored prominently in pain severity analysis."

  - id: 2
    title: "The Arrival That Sets the Tone"
    icon: "🚪"
    primary_stage: 4
    adjacent_stages: [3, 5]
    criteria_score: "5/5"
    feasibility_note: null
    customer_promise: >
      The customer will walk away from check-in feeling genuinely welcomed — not processed —
      and with a positive first physical impression of Scandic that frames everything that follows.
    customer_value:
      - "Arrival is the first physical moment where Scandic's brand promise either lands or fails — first impressions disproportionately shape memory of the entire stay."
      - "Guests consistently forgive check-in queues if the waiting time is made pleasant (free coffee, genuine warmth)."
    business_value:
      - "Arrival/check-in scored 4.4 — high, but with clear pain points (slow check-in, inconsistent loyalty recognition, key cards) showing a gap between perception and reality."
      - "The Marketplace Lobby WOW initiative is already resourced and in concept; hero moment framing accelerates it."
    what_great_looks_like:
      - "A loyal member walks in and is addressed by name within 30 seconds, without presenting ID; receives a personal acknowledgement of their loyalty ('Welcome back — this is your 12th stay with us')."
      - "A family arrives with children after a long drive; the children receive a small surprise gift, and the parent is offered a seat and a drink while the room is prepared."
    failure_modes:
      - "Staff turnover and inconsistent training mean the warm welcome is delivered by some employees at some hotels but not reliably across the estate."
      - "Digital check-in can reduce wait times but risks removing the human moment entirely if not designed as an enhancement rather than a replacement."
    key_evidence:
      - "Gain points G1–G4 (welcome note, surprise gift, info-kit, room upgrade) all concentrate at arrival."
      - "WOW Initiative #3 ('The Marketplace Lobby Experience') is the most elaborated of the five."
      - "D1 (slow check-in) ranks 3rd highest in total pain severity in leisure."
      - "XENA persona Lennart: 'I like the personal contact.'"

  - id: 3
    title: "The Moment You Feel Seen"
    icon: "👁️"
    primary_stage: 5
    adjacent_stages: [4, 7]
    criteria_score: "5/5"
    feasibility_note: "CRM-limited"
    customer_promise: >
      The customer will experience at least one interaction during their stay — from staff,
      room personalisation, or digital service — that demonstrates Scandic knows them and has
      made their stay easier or more enjoyable because of it.
    customer_value:
      - "'Make the customer feel seen — important to not feel as a can of sardines in the factory' is gain point G5, cited across all four leisure segments."
      - "Personalisation is the top driver gap: guests whose preferences are known rate their stay significantly higher."
    business_value:
      - "Member benefits are the single lowest-rated touchpoint (3.3 for Habituals) — but the Habitual is Scandic's most loyal and highest-frequency guest. Closing this gap has the highest retention upside."
      - "WOW Initiative #4 (Personalised Guest Experience via Salesforce/EasyGuest) is directly scoped to this moment."
    what_great_looks_like:
      - "A Top Floor member receives a proactive SMS before arrival noting their preferred room type is assigned, with a brief note about tonight's bar special."
      - "A first-time family guest finds their children mentioned by name in the room welcome note and a small age-appropriate gift on the children's bed (not handed out mechanically at the desk)."
    failure_modes:
      - "CRM dependency: this hero moment is currently limited by Scandic's ability to hold and activate guest preference data across properties."
      - "Over-personalisation or poorly executed gestures risk feeling intrusive rather than warm — the execution standard must be carefully defined before scaling."
    key_evidence:
      - "Pain I (personal preferences not taken into account) appears for 3 of 5 business segments."
      - "WOW Initiative #1 ('A warm guest interaction') names feeling seen as the primary design intent."
      - "WOW Initiative #4: 'As a guest when I interact with Scandic, both physical and digital, Scandic knows who I am and what I need.'"
      - "Gain G6: 'Adapt communication and action based on purpose of stay.'"

  - id: 4
    title: "Breakfast as the Memory Anchor"
    icon: "🥐"
    primary_stage: 5
    adjacent_stages: [6]
    criteria_score: "5/5"
    feasibility_note: null
    customer_promise: >
      The customer will experience a breakfast that exceeds their expectation in at least one
      specific, memorable way — turning a routine meal into a positive story they carry away from the hotel.
    customer_value:
      - "'Breakfast is one of the most important things when choosing a hotel' [XENA persona Monica] and 'the most important meal at the hotel' for leisure guests."
      - "Breakfast-related pains (queuing, running out of food, early closing) are the highest-severity free-text pain category in leisure (combined score 12.74 in Gavagai analysis)."
    business_value:
      - "Restaurant experience rated 3.7 in leisure — joint-lowest touchpoint — but gain point G9 ('Surprisingly good breakfast') suggests a low-cost, high-impact improvement path."
      - "Memory research supports breakfast as a 'peak' moment in short stays; improving it raises overall NPS disproportionately."
    what_great_looks_like:
      - "A guest encounters at least one unexpected, sensory element at breakfast — freshly baked waffles, a staff member offering to cook their eggs, a genuine local product — that they photograph or mention to someone that day."
      - "A family with children finds the breakfast station visually designed to engage children: appropriate height, fun presentation, something small but memorable for kids."
    failure_modes:
      - "Breakfast quality is highly variable by hotel and season — temporary or undertrained staff produce the worst complaints."
      - "Scaling a 'surprising' element is hard: what surprises guests the first time becomes expected the second time, requiring ongoing menu/concept investment."
    key_evidence:
      - "G9 ('Surprisingly good breakfast'): better OJ, real scrambled eggs, egg cooked to order, waffles, coffee refill offered proactively."
      - "Breakfast closing too early (E11) is a specific pain; hotels with later closing hours receive notably better ratings."
      - "XENA persona Monica: 'Breakfast is one of the most important things when choosing a hotel.'"
      - "Breakfast ranked highest-severity in pain frequency analysis."

  - id: 5
    title: "The Loyalty Loop That Brings You Back"
    icon: "🔄"
    primary_stage: 7
    adjacent_stages: [2, 6]
    criteria_score: "5/5"
    feasibility_note: "programme-limited"
    customer_promise: >
      The customer will receive post-stay communication and loyalty recognition that feels
      genuinely relevant, easy to act on, and that makes them more likely to choose Scandic
      for their next trip — not less.
    customer_value:
      - "Post-stay communication is the lowest-rated touchpoint in the business journey (3.7) — a consistent drag on overall satisfaction for the guests Scandic most needs to keep."
      - "Existing loyal members (Habituals, Scandic Friends) are currently the least satisfied segment; the loyalty programme is experienced as a downgrade from the previous programme."
    business_value:
      - "The Habitual segment (~10% of business guests) travels weekly and is worth disproportionate revenue; their 4.13 score is the lowest of all business segments, driven largely by member benefits (3.3)."
      - "Improving post-stay relevance and loyalty programme usability addresses both retention and re-acquisition — the two highest-priority business objectives from 2017."
    what_great_looks_like:
      - "A guest who rated their stay 4/5 receives a single, personalised post-stay message within 24 hours that references their specific stay, shows their new points balance, and offers one genuinely relevant forward offer — not a newsletter."
      - "A Scandic Friends member can see, in one screen, exactly how many points they have, what they can redeem them for, and what their fastest path to a free night is."
    failure_modes:
      - "The current technology stack (multiple legacy systems: MAP, Ariane, Scorpio, SGS) makes truly personalised post-stay communication difficult without significant integration work."
      - "The loyalty programme's complexity means improving communication around a structurally flawed programme may not be enough — the programme itself may need to be simplified first."
    key_evidence:
      - "Post-stay comms rated 3.7 with high correlation to overall satisfaction."
      - "Scandic Friends disappointments (F3, F4): programme complexity, point registration failures, cumbersome login."
      - "'Too much and/or irrelevant post-stay communication' is pain F1, appearing for Habituals and Confirmation Seekers."
      - "Gain G13 ('Better Scandic Friends') and G11 ('Don't ask for Tripadvisor review unless NPS high') both target this moment."
